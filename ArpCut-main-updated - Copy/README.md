Push the repo to GitHub, open the **Actions** tab, run workflow **Build Release**, then download artifact **ArpCutUpdated-Windows-Installer** from the completed run. Step-by-step: see **`HOW-TO-DOWNLOAD-INSTALLER.txt`** in the repo root.

| Linux | `ArpCut` | Experimental |

**Requirements:** Administrator/root privileges required.

If the pre-built binaries don't work on your machine, build from source (see below).

## Installation from Source

### Windows

1. Install Python 3.8+ from [python.org](https://python.org/downloads) - check "Add to PATH"
2. Install [Npcap](https://npcap.com/) - check "WinPcap API-compatible Mode"
3. Clone and run:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Mvgnu/ArpCut.git
cd ArpCut
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src\elmocut.py
```

Run as Administrator.

### macOS

1. Install Python:
```bash
brew install python@3.11
```

2. Clone and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mvgnu/ArpCut.git
cd ArpCut
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo python3 src/elmocut.py
```

## Building

Install PyInstaller, then run the build script:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller pillow
python build.py
```

That's it. Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Output:
- Windows: `dist/ArpCutUpdated.exe` (this fork; separate from stock `ArpCut.exe`)
- macOS: `dist/ArpCutUpdated.app`
- Linux: `dist/ArpCutUpdated`

**Windows installer (optional):** Install [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php), then run `installer\Build-Installer.bat`. The setup wizard installs to `Program Files\ArpCut Updated` and writes settings under `%APPDATA%\ArpCutUpdated` so it does not replace an existing ArpCut install. See `installer/HOWTO-INSTALLER.txt`.
